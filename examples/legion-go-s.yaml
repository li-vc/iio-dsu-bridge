# iio-dsu-bridge configuration for Legion Go S
#
# Copy this file to ~/.config/iio-dsu-bridge.yaml
#
# The Legion Go S exposes accelerometer and gyroscope as separate IIO devices.
# This configuration fixes the accelerometer Z-axis inversion that causes
# the "pulling back" issue in emulators.

# Accelerometer mount matrix
# Z-axis is inverted to match the expected gravity direction
accel_matrix:
  x: [1, 0, 0]
  y: [0, 1, 0]
  z: [0, 0, -1]

# Gyroscope mount matrix
# Identity matrix (no transformation needed)
gyro_matrix:
  x: [1, 0, 0]
  y: [0, 1, 0]
  z: [0, 0, 1]
